                <p><i>Where does the arctic wolf live?</i></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The arctic wolf mainly inhabits the arctic regions of North America and Greenland</li>
                    <li>Because they live in isolated places, the Arctic wolf is not threatened by hunting and habitat destruction</li>
                    <li>The main habitats of the Arctic Wolf are in a Tundra which is a type of biome where the growth of trees is limited by the low temperatures and short growing seasons</li>
                    <li>The Arctic wolf can survive in some of the coldest places on earth, they have a number of anatomical, behavioural and physiological adaptations that help them do this</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="Item">
                <p><i>General facts</i></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The extinction status of the Arctic wolf is the least concern. Other wolf species also have stable populations and are not threatened</li>
                    <li>The scientific name of an Arctic wolf is Canis Lupus Arctos. The arctic wolf is also known as the polar wolf or the white wolf. It belongs to the Canidae family and its animal class is Mammalia</li>
                    <li>The speed of an arctic wolf can reach up to around 64 km per hour for short periods of time</li>
                    <li>The arctic wolf is able to withstand sub-zero temperatures and up to 5 months of absolute darkness in a year</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="Item">
                <p><i>Physical attributes</i></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The length of an arctic wolf is about 1-1.8 meters including their tail. Their tail can measure from 60-90 cm</li>
                    <li>They weigh 45-70 kgs. Wolf pups only weigh 1-2 kgs when born but they rapidly gain weight</li>
                    <li>During the winter the Arctic wolf grows a second layer of fur for protection against the harsh conditions</li>
                    <li>Arctic wolves are smaller than grey wolves. They also have smaller ears and shorter muzzles to retain body heat</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="Item">
                <p><i>Population</i></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The population of the arctic wolf is around 200,000. One of the largest populations of the arctic wolf can be found in Northern Alaska</li>
                    <li>There are around 6 wolves in a pack of arctic wolfs</li>
                    <li>The main population threats of the arctic wolf population are climate change and industrial development which can destroy their habitats</li>
                    <li>Arctic wolves are carnivorous hunters. By nature, they help to control the populations of other animals in the region</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="Item">
                <p><i>Lifetime</i></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The lifespan of the arctic wolf is around 7-10 years in the wild and around 20 years in captivity</li>
                    <li>The oldest arctic wolf is a Canadian wolf named Maddie who is 19 years old and grew up in a wolf sanctuary</li>
                    <li>Generally, grown pups stay with the same pack they had for a long time</li>
                    <li>The most common reasons that arctic wolves are killed are because of injury or a harsh climate</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="Item">
                <p><i>Diet</i></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Arctic wolves are predatory carnivores and eat a wide variety of food. They always hunt in packs</li>
                    <li>They mainly eat musk-oxen, caribou, arctic hares, lemmings, ptarmigan, and other small animals such as nesting birds</li>
                    <li>A large mammal that has been hunted will usually be consumed over the course of a week by a pack of wolves</li>
                    <li>An arctic wolf is able to eat about 20 pounds of animal meat in one feeding period. That is about 9 kgs</li>
                    <li>The arctic wolf’s main source of hydration is water</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="Item">
                <p><i>Threats</i></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Unlike other species of wolves, the Arctic wolf rarely comes in contact with humans so they do not face the threat of hunting</li>
                    <li>The greatest threat to an arctic wolf is climate change. Due to the change of weather, it is harder for the arctic wolves to find muskox and Arctic hares which reduces their food supply</li>
                    <li>Industrial development also poses a threat to the wolf, as an increasing number of mines, roads and pipelines invade the wolf’s territory</li>
                    <li>Polar bears are the only animal predators of the Arctic wolf. If a young wolf cub wanders out of its cave, it can easily be killed by a polar bear</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="Item">
                <p><i>Adaptions</i></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Wolves have a thick layer of body fat which is a helpful adaptation to keep them warm and for food storage in winter</li>
                    <li>Wolves also have thick and camouflaged fur to protect them from the cold and from any predators or hunters</li>
                    <li>Arctic wolves also have smaller ears compared to grey wolves meaning they have less surface area to lose heat</li>
                    <li>They also have fur on their paws to insulate them from snow and ice</li>
                    <li>Most of the adaptations of an arctic wolf are to protect them from the cold which is how they withstand cold climates</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="Item">
                <p><i>Communications</i></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Arctic wolves mainly communicate through: sounds such as howls, barks, whines and growls, special scents and body language</li>
                    <li>Wolves use body language to convey the rules of the pack. A wolf pack is very organized and ‘communication’ is key</li>
                    <li>If they are angry, wolves may bare their teeth and stick up their ears</li>
                    <li>Whenever you hear a wolf howling, it is not because of the moon it is because the wolves are communicating with one another</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
